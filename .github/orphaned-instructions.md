# Orphaned Instruction Items (Historical Reference)

> Purpose: Preserve verbatim legacy content blocks that were intentionally NOT migrated verbatim to path-specific instruction files. Each block below includes: (a) Original Text (b) Why It Is Orphaned (c) Recommended Disposition Options (d) Impact If Deleted.

## Disposition Legend
- KEEP-AS-IS: Retain verbatim in universal file (rare; only if global & still current)
- CONDENSE: Replace with shorter summary in path-specific file (already done elsewhere)
- MOVE: Relocate verbatim into specific path file (apps / scripts / release / docs)
- ARCHIVE: Keep only here for historical audit; remove from active files
- DROP: Safe to delete (no functional effect)

## 1. VS Code Tasks Catalog (Verbatim)

### Original Text
```

```

### Why Orphaned
This enumerated list is descriptive, not procedural. Task behavior now documented in `scripts.instructions.md` (automation flows) and `actions.instructions.md` (validation). Keeping verbatim list is optional.

### Recommended Disposition
CONDENSE (already done) or ARCHIVE here; do not duplicate into active universal file long-term.

### Impact If Deleted
No loss of functional automation logic‚Äîtasks themselves remain defined in `tasks.json`. Minimal discoverability loss.

---

## 2. PowerShell Scripts Catalog (Verbatim)

### Original Text
```
### **ÔøΩ PowerShell Scripts (17 Scripts)**
**Comprehensive Automation Suite:**

#### **Core Development Scripts:**
- `workspace-cleanup.ps1` - Advanced workspace organization with safety patterns
- `repo-health-check.ps1` - Multi-layer repository validation and reporting
- `validate-changelog.ps1` - CHANGELOG format validation with auto-fix capabilities
- `safe-commit.ps1` - Interactive commit process with quality gates

#### **Environment Management:**
- `config.psm1` - Multi-environment configuration management
- `prepare-release.ps1` - Release preparation and artifact generation
- `powerapps-web.ps1` - Web development workflow helper
```

### Why Orphaned
Superseded by richer procedural guidance in `scripts.instructions.md` and by the new Script Reference Table in v2 (which added `add-license-headers.ps1`).

### Recommended Disposition
ARCHIVE. Consider moving any missing script purposes into inline comments inside the scripts themselves.

### Impact If Deleted
No functional loss; helps reduce duplication.

## 3. VA USGov Environment Reference (Verbatim)

### Original Text
```
### VA USGov Power Platform Environment Reference

| Parameter                | Value                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment ID           | e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf                                   |
| Tenant ID                | e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf                                   |
| Organization Unique Name | org34322538                                                            |
| Organization Friendly    | Department of Veterans Affairs (default)                               |
| Cloud                    | UsGov                                                                  |
| Authority                | https://login.microsoftonline.com/e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf |
| User                     | Kyle.Coder@va.gov                                                      |
```

### Why Orphaned
Potentially sensitive identifiers; not required in every AI context. Path-specific Power Apps file already documents authentication pattern without full table.

### Recommended Disposition
ARCHIVE or MOVE to a new `environment.instructions.md` if frequent reuse is needed.

### Impact If Deleted
Loss of quick copy/paste reference; no behavioral impact.

## 4. CLI Authorization Onboarding Steps (Verbatim)

### Original Text
```
### How to Set Up CLI Authorization for Future Users (VA USGov)

1. **Install Power Platform CLI:**
   - Download and install from: https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformCLI

2. **Open PowerShell and run:**
   pac auth create --environment "e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf" --tenant "e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf" --cloud "UsGov" --name "<YOUR_PROFILE_NAME>"
   - Sign in with your VA credentials when prompted.

3. **Verify your connection:**
   pac auth who
   - Confirm the output matches the environment and user info above.

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you get an environment error, try using just the GUID for `--environment`.
   - Always use `--cloud "UsGov"` for government tenants.
   - For multiple profiles, use `pac auth list` and `pac auth select --index <n>`.

5. **Reference:**
   - Power Platform CLI Docs: https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformCLI
```

### Why Orphaned
Detailed onboarding seldom needed in day-to-day AI completions; core command standardized in path-specific file.

### Recommended Disposition
CONDENSE in `power-apps.instructions.md` (already partially) & ARCHIVE verbatim here.

### Impact If Deleted
Slight onboarding friction for new contributors; no runtime impact.

---

## 5. Standard Response Phrases (Verbatim)

### Original Text
```
Standard Security Response: "This operation requires administrator privileges which are restricted on VA Healthcare enterprise systems. I'll provide user-scope alternatives that comply with your security policies."
Standard Workspace Cleanup Response: "Executing comprehensive workspace cleanup and file organization..."
Standard Repository Health Response: "Executing comprehensive repository health check and validation..."
Standard Commit Workflow Response: "Executing automated local git commit workflow..."
Standard Continuation Response: "Continuing with the remaining tasks to complete the full workflow..."
Standard Execution Response: "Executing [task name] to continue the workflow..."
Standard Recovery Response: "I encountered a content filter issue with my previous response. Let me complete your request using a summarized approach that avoids the filtering problem while still accomplishing your original goal."
```

### Why Orphaned
Semantic variants now implied by protocols; duplicating every phrase increases maintenance overhead.

### Recommended Disposition
CONDENSE: Keep one canonical phrasing per protocol in active files; ARCHIVE originals here.

### Impact If Deleted
No functional loss; minor reduction in wording consistency reference.

## Guidance Summary Table
| Orphan Item | Reason | Suggested Action | Functional Risk if Removed |
|-------------|--------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| VS Code Tasks Catalog | Descriptive only | Archive | None |
| Scripts Catalog | Superseded by table | Archive | None |
| Environment Reference | Sensitive / rarely needed | Archive or Move | None |
| CLI Onboarding Steps | Duplicate detail | Archive (condense kept) | Low |
| Standard Response Phrases | Redundant wording | Condense & Archive | None |

---

## Next Steps Decisions
1. Accept defaults (Archive all).
2. Promote any item to active universal file (remove from orphan list & embed in v2 permanently).
3. Create new specialized file (e.g., `environment.instructions.md`) for environment table if used often.
4. Delete items after confirmation (final cleanup prior to activation).

Please mark decisions per item before activation; no behavior changes occur until legacy file is archived.
