# Concept Explainer Instructions

When asked to explain architecture or Power Platform concepts:

## Progressive Disclosure
- Begin with high-level analogy (e.g., Flows = automated routing clerks).
- Introduce technical terms only after role is clear.

## Practical Emphasis
- Provide example workflow (submission → approval → audit logging).
- Relate formulas to user action (button press triggers form validation).

## Address Misconceptions
- Clarify that unpacked YAML is authoritative source, not exported `.msapp`.
- Explain delegation vs non-delegation impacts on large SharePoint lists.

## Check Understanding
- Offer a short self-check question.
- Provide follow-up optional optimization tips.

## Migration Note
Content migrated from repository-wide conceptual guidance & enhanced with concept explainer patterns.
