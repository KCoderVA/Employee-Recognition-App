## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Initial development and unit testing
- **Data**: Synthetic test data only
- **Access**: Development team only
- **Refresh**: Weekly from production structure

### Testing Environment
- **Purpose**: Integration and system testing
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like data
- **Access**: Development and QA teams
- **Refresh**: Bi-weekly from production

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation and UAT
- **Data**: Production-like data (sanitized)
- **Access**: All project stakeholders
- **Refresh**: Monthly or before major releases

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live system with real users and data
- **Data**: Live production data
- **Access**: End users and administrators only
- **Monitoring**: Continuous performance and error monitoring

## Power Apps Testing

### Formula Testing
```javascript
// Test Cases for Power Apps Formulas
Test_UserProfileLookup:
- Valid user email returns correct profile
- Invalid user email returns empty result
- Null/empty email handles gracefully

Test_AwardTypeValidation:
- Valid award type loads correct form
- Invalid award type shows error message
- Form fields populate correctly based on type

Test_SubmissionValidation:
- Required fields enforce validation
- Character limits prevent excessive input
- Email format validation works correctly
```

### Control Testing
- **Button Actions**: All button clicks perform expected actions
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation provides immediate feedback
- **Navigation**: Screen transitions work smoothly
- **Data Loading**: Collections populate correctly from SharePoint
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### Performance Testing
- **Load Times**: App loads within 3 seconds on mobile
- **Response Times**: Form submissions complete within 5 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: App remains stable during extended use
- **Offline Capability**: Core functions work without internet

## Power Automate Testing

### Flow Testing
```yaml
Test Scenarios:
  SubmissionFlow:
    - Trigger: New nomination created in SharePoint
    - Expected: Email sent to manager within 1 minute
    - Validation: Email contains correct nominee and nominator info

  ApprovalFlow:
    - Trigger: Approval response received
    - Expected: SharePoint updated and next approver notified
    - Validation: Approval history captured correctly

  EscalationFlow:
    - Trigger: Approval timeout reached
    - Expected: Escalation email sent to next level
    - Validation: Timeout calculated correctly based on business rules
```

### Error Handling Testing
- **Service Unavailability**: Graceful handling when SharePoint unavailable
- **Invalid Data**: Proper error messages for malformed data
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic for transient failures
- **Permission Errors**: Clear error messages for access issues

## SharePoint Testing

### List Testing
- **Data Integrity**: All required fields enforce validation
- **View Performance**: Large datasets load efficiently
- **Permission Testing**: Role-based access works correctly
- **Workflow Integration**: SharePoint workflows trigger properly

### Security Testing
- **Authentication**: Only authenticated users can access
- **Authorization**: Users see only data they should access
- **Data Leakage**: No unauthorized data exposure
- **Audit Trail**: All actions properly logged

## Test Cases by User Role

### Standard User Test Cases
```yaml
Scenario: Submit Starfish Award
  Given: User is authenticated in the application
  When: User selects "Starfish Award" and fills required fields
  Then: Nomination is saved to SharePoint and confirmation displayed
  And: Nominee's manager receives notification email

Scenario: View Submission History
  Given: User has previously submitted nominations
  When: User navigates to "My Submissions"
  Then: All user's submissions are displayed with current status
  And: User can view details of each submission
```

### Manager Test Cases
```yaml
Scenario: Approve Team Nomination
  Given: Manager receives approval request in Teams
  When: Manager clicks "Approve" in Teams notification
  Then: Nomination status updates to approved
  And: Submitter receives approval confirmation

Scenario: Request Additional Information
  Given: Manager reviews nomination requiring clarification
  When: Manager selects "Request Info" and adds comments
  Then: Nomination returns to submitter with manager comments
  And: Submitter receives notification to provide additional info
```

### Committee Member Test Cases
```yaml
Scenario: Triage HRO Nomination
  Given: Committee member receives new HRO nomination for review
  When: Member reviews nomination packet and routes to sub-committee
  Then: Nomination assigned to appropriate sub-committee
  And: Sub-committee members receive review assignment

Scenario: Final Approval Decision
  Given: Committee has completed full review of nomination
  When: Committee member makes final approval decision
  Then: Nomination status updates to final status
  And: All stakeholders receive outcome notification
```

### Administrator Test Cases
```yaml
Scenario: Configure New Award Type
  Given: Administrator needs to add new award category
  When: Admin creates new entry in Award Categories list
  Then: New award type appears in Power Apps within 5 minutes
  And: Form fields render correctly based on configuration

Scenario: Monitor System Performance
