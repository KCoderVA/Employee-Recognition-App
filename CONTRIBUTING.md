## Code of Conduct

This project follows the VA's standards for professional conduct. All contributors are expected to:
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive collaboration
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive information
- Follow VA IT security guidelines

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to VA Power Platform environment
- Power Platform CLI (pac) installed
- VS Code with Power Platform extensions
- Git for version control

### Development Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required VS Code extensions (see `.vscode/extensions.json`)
3. Configure your Power Platform environment connection
4. Review the project documentation in `/docs/`

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Change Request Process
1. All changes must be linked to a documented Change Request (CR)
2. Reference the CR number in commit messages
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes
4. Follow the established version numbering scheme

### Version Numbering
We use semantic versioning with three-part numbering:
- Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 0.8.3)
- Each Change Request gets a unique version increment
- See CHANGELOG.md for the complete versioning history

## Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/CR-XXX-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following Power Platform best practices

3. **Update documentation**
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
   - Update relevant README.md files
   - Add/update technical documentation in `/docs/`

4. **Test thoroughly**
   - Test in development environment
   - Verify all Power Automate flows work correctly
   - Check SharePoint list integrations
   - Validate Power Apps functionality

5. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Use descriptive title with CR number
   - Include detailed description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Request review from project maintainers

### Commit Message Guidelines
```
CR-XXX: Brief description of change

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
Include any breaking changes or special deployment notes.

- Component 1: Specific change made
- Component 2: Another specific change
```

## Power Platform Best Practices

### Power Apps
- Use descriptive control names (btnSubmit, lblTitle, galItems)
- Group related controls in containers
- Implement proper error handling with User() and IsError() functions
- Follow consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for apps, camelCase for variables)
- Document complex formulas with comments

### Power Automate
- Use descriptive action names
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch patterns
- Use parallel branches where possible for performance
- Document business logic with comments
- Use compose actions for complex expressions

### SharePoint
- Follow consistent list and column naming conventions
- Use content types for structured data
- Implement proper permissions and security
- Document list relationships and dependencies

### Documentation
- Update all relevant documentation with changes
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Document any new configuration requirements
- Update training materials if user-facing changes

## Repository Structure & File Policy

### üìÅ **Public Repository (GitHub)**
The GitHub repository contains only user-relevant files:
- Source code and documentation that users need to run or contribute to the project
- Essential README files, contribution guidelines, and security policies
- GitHub workflows and issue templates

### üè† **Local Development Environment**
Your local repository contains additional development resources:
- **VS Code Settings** - Personal workspace configurations
- **Scripts & Automation** - Developer tools and repository management utilities  
- **Testing Data** - Test files, validation data, and debugging information
- **Archive Materials** - Historical exports, backups, and reference documents
- **Binary Files** - Excel files, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams
- **Environment Configs** - Environment-specific settings and credentials

### üîÑ **Contribution Workflow**
When contributing:
1. **Edit only public files** - Focus on source code and documentation in `src/` and `docs/`
2. **Test locally** - Use your complete local environment for development and testing
3. **Commit selectively** - Only commit changes to files tracked in the public repository
4. **Reference local materials** - Feel free to reference local documentation in commit messages

This separation ensures the GitHub repository remains clean and professional while preserving your complete development environment locally.

## Testing Requirements

### Before Submitting
- [ ] Power Apps loads without errors
- [ ] All Power Automate flows execute successfully
- [ ] SharePoint integrations work correctly
- [ ] No broken links or references
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] UI/UX follows established patterns

### Testing Environments
- **Development**: Initial testing and validation
- **Testing**: Stakeholder review and acceptance testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live environment (deploy only after full approval)

## Review Process

1. **Technical Review**: Code quality, architecture, best practices
2. **Functional Review**: Feature completeness, user experience
3. **Security Review**: Compliance with VA security standards
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Business requirements and approval

## Questions or Issues?

- Review existing documentation in `/docs/`
- Check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes
