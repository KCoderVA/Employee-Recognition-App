## Code of Conduct

This project follows VA and open source standards for professional conduct. All contributors are expected to:
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive collaboration
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive information
- Follow VA IT security and privacy guidelines
- Ensure all public contributions are professional and appropriate for a wide audience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to a VA Power Platform environment (or test tenant)
- Power Platform CLI (`pac`) installed
- Visual Studio Code with Power Platform extensions
- Git for version control
- PowerShell 7+ for automation scripts

### Setup Steps
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Configure your Power Platform environment connection
3. Review project documentation in `/docs/`
4. Run initial health check: `pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/repo-health-check.ps1`

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Change Request Process
1. All changes must be linked to a documented Change Request (CR)
2. Reference the CR number in commit messages
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes
4. Follow the established version numbering scheme (see below)

### Version Numbering
Semantic versioning is used:
- Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 1.0.1)
- Each Change Request gets a unique version increment
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for full version history

## Submission Guidelines

### How to Propose a Change
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes, following the guidelines below
3. Open a pull request with a clear title and description
4. Reference any related issues or change requests
5. Use the template below for your PR description:

```
### Summary
Briefly describe the change and its purpose.

### Related Issue(s)
Link to any related issues or change requests.

### Testing
Describe how you tested your change.
```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop` or `main`
2. **Make your changes** following Power Platform best practices
3. **Update documentation** as needed (CHANGELOG, README, docs/)
4. **Test thoroughly** in your environment
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear title, description, and references
6. **Request review** from project maintainers

### Commit Message Guidelines
```
CR-XXX: Brief description of change

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
Include any breaking changes or special deployment notes.

- Component 1: Specific change made
- Component 2: Another specific change
```

## Power Platform Best Practices

### Power Apps
- Use descriptive control names (btnSubmit, lblTitle, galItems)
- Group related controls in containers
- Implement proper error handling with User() and IsError() functions
- Follow consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for apps, camelCase for variables)
- Document complex formulas with comments

### Power Automate
- Use descriptive action names
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch patterns
- Use parallel branches where possible for performance
- Document business logic with comments
- Use compose actions for complex expressions

### SharePoint
- Follow consistent list and column naming conventions
- Use content types for structured data
- Implement proper permissions and security
- Document list relationships and dependencies

### Documentation
- Update all relevant documentation with changes
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Document any new configuration requirements
- Update training materials if user-facing changes

## Repository Structure & File Policy

### üìÅ Public Repository (GitHub)
The GitHub repository contains only user-relevant files:
- Source code and documentation needed to run or contribute to the project
- Essential README files, contribution guidelines, and security policies
- GitHub workflows and issue templates

### üè† Local Development Environment
Your local repository may contain additional development resources:
- VS Code settings and personal workspace configurations
- Scripts and automation for developer use
- Testing data, validation files, and debugging information
- Archive materials, historical exports, and reference documents
- Binary files (Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, etc.)
- Environment-specific settings and credentials

### üîÑ Contribution Workflow
When contributing:
1. **Edit only public files** ‚Äì Focus on source code and documentation in `src/` and `docs/`
2. **Test locally** ‚Äì Use your complete local environment for development and testing
3. **Commit selectively** ‚Äì Only commit changes to files tracked in the public repository
4. **Reference local materials** ‚Äì You may reference local documentation in commit messages

This separation ensures the GitHub repository remains clean and professional while preserving your complete development environment locally.

## Testing & Review

### Before Submitting
- [ ] Power Apps loads without errors
- [ ] All Power Automate flows execute successfully
- [ ] SharePoint integrations work correctly
- [ ] No broken links or references
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

- **Testing**: Stakeholder review and acceptance testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live environment (deploy only after full approval)

### Review Process
1. **Technical Review**: Code quality, architecture, best practices
2. **Functional Review**: Feature completeness, user experience
3. **Security Review**: Compliance with VA security standards
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Business requirements and approval

## Questions or Issues?

- Review existing documentation in `/docs/`
- Check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes
