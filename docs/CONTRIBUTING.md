- Ensure all public contributions are professional and appropriate for a wide audience.
## How to Propose a Change

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes, following the guidelines below.
3. Open a pull request with a clear title and description.
4. Reference any related issues or change requests.
5. Use the template below for your PR description:

```
### Summary
Briefly describe the change and its purpose.

### Related Issue(s)
Link to any related issues or change requests.

### Testing
Describe how you tested your change.
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to VA Power Platform environment
- Power Platform CLI (pac) installed
- VS Code with Power Platform extensions
- Git for version control
- PowerShell 7+ for automation scripts

### Development Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required VS Code extensions (see `.vscode/extensions.json`)
3. Configure your Power Platform environment connection
4. Review the project documentation in `/docs/`
5. Run initial health check: `pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/repo-health-check.ps1`

### Current Development Focus (v0.9.49)
- **Power Fx Reset Logic**: Refined for complex screens (27 resettable controls, 320-character formula, 4 iterations)
- **YAML Screen Analysis**: Advanced automation and extraction (1,200+ lines analyzed)
- **Enhanced Automation**: 33+ VS Code tasks and 17+ PowerShell scripts
- **Security Compliance**: VA Healthcare enterprise security restrictions
- **Web-Only Development**: Optimized Power Apps development workflow
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive CHANGELOG enforcement and validation

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for the latest details and contribution context.

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Change Request Process
1. All changes must be linked to a documented Change Request (CR)
2. Reference the CR number in commit messages
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes
4. Follow the established version numbering scheme

### Version Numbering
We use semantic versioning with three-part numbering:
- Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 0.8.3)
- Each Change Request gets a unique version increment
- See CHANGELOG.md for the complete versioning history

## Submission Guidelines


### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop` or `main`.
2. **Make your changes** following Power Platform best practices.
3. **Update documentation** as needed (CHANGELOG, README, docs/).
4. **Test thoroughly** in your environment.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear title, description, and references.
6. **Request review** from project maintainers.

### Commit Message Guidelines
```
CR-XXX: Brief description of change

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
Include any breaking changes or special deployment notes.

- Component 1: Specific change made
- Component 2: Another specific change
```

## Power Platform Best Practices

### Power Apps
- Use descriptive control names (btnSubmit, lblTitle, galItems)
- Group related controls in containers
- Implement proper error handling with User() and IsError() functions
- Follow consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for apps, camelCase for variables)
- Document complex formulas with comments

### Power Automate
- Use descriptive action names
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch patterns
- Use parallel branches where possible for performance
- Document business logic with comments
- Use compose actions for complex expressions

### SharePoint
- Follow consistent list and column naming conventions
- Use content types for structured data
- Implement proper permissions and security
- Document list relationships and dependencies

### Documentation
- Update all relevant documentation with changes
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Document any new configuration requirements
- Update training materials if user-facing changes

## Repository Structure & File Policy

### üìÅ **Public Repository (GitHub)**
The GitHub repository contains only user-relevant files:
- Source code and documentation that users need to run or contribute to the project
- Essential README files, contribution guidelines, and security policies
- GitHub workflows and issue templates

### üè† **Local Development Environment**
Your local repository contains additional development resources:
- **VS Code Settings** - Personal workspace configurations
- **Scripts & Automation** - Developer tools and repository management utilities
- **Testing Data** - Test files, validation data, and debugging information
- **Archive Materials** - Historical exports, backups, and reference documents
- **Binary Files** - Excel files, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams
- **Environment Configs** - Environment-specific settings and credentials

### üîÑ **Contribution Workflow**
When contributing:
1. **Edit only public files** - Focus on source code and documentation in `src/` and `docs/`
2. **Test locally** - Use your complete local environment for development and testing
3. **Commit selectively** - Only commit changes to files tracked in the public repository
4. **Reference local materials** - Feel free to reference local documentation in commit messages

This separation ensures the GitHub repository remains clean and professional while preserving your complete development environment locally.

## Testing Requirements

## Review Process

1. **Technical Review**: Code quality, architecture, best practices
2. **Functional Review**: Feature completeness, user experience
3. **Security Review**: Compliance with VA security standards
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Business requirements and approval
