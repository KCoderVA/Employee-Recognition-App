# Workspace Verification Complete - All Systems Working

## 🔍 Comprehensive Workspace Verification Results

I have thoroughly checked your entire workspace and project to ensure that the repository manager migration and all related changes are working properly.

## ✅ Issues Found and Fixed

### **1. PowerShell Command Issue in Batch File**
- **Problem**: The batch file was using `powershell` instead of `pwsh`, causing Unicode character encoding issues
- **Solution**: Updated all PowerShell calls in the batch file to use `pwsh` for better Unicode support
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Batch file now works correctly

### **2. Empty File Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Found an empty `repository_cleanup_only.bat` file in repository_manager folder
- **Solution**: Removed the empty file
- **Status**: ✅ **CLEANED UP**
