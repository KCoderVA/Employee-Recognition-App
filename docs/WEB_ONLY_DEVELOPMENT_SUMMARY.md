2. Choose: **"📦 Package Power App v0.9.0 (Source Control)"**
3. Choose: **"🌐 Open Power Apps Web Portal"**
4. Import .msapp manually in web browser
5. Test and validate in Power Apps web editor

### **Option 2: PowerShell Commands**
```powershell
# Package app
.\scripts\powerapps-web.ps1 package

# Open portal
.\scripts\powerapps-web.ps1 open-portal

# Check status
.\scripts\powerapps-web.ps1 status
```

### **Option 3: Command Line**
```powershell
# Manual packaging
pac canvas pack --sources "./src/power-apps/EmployeeRecognitionApp_v0.9.0/Source" --msapp "./releases/v0.9.x/EmployeeRecognitionApp_v0.9.0.msapp"

# Open portal
Start-Process "https://make.powerapps.com"
```

## ⚠️ Web-Only Considerations (Already Documented)

- **❌ No automated deployment** - Manual upload to Power Apps web required
- **❌ No direct save** from Power Apps web to source control
- **❌ Desktop Power Apps Studio** unavailable (organization policy)
- **✅ Full functionality** available through web browser
- **✅ Source control friendly** - All files are text-based YAML

## 📂 Key Files and Folders

| **Path** | **Purpose** |
|----------|-------------|
| `src/power-apps/EmployeeRecognitionApp_v0.9.0/Source/` | Edit these .fx.yaml files |
| `releases/v0.9.x/` | Upload these .msapp files |
| `docs/POWER_APPS_WEB_REFERENCE.md` | Quick reference guide |
| `scripts/powerapps-web.ps1` | Helper commands |

## 🎯 Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **📝 Edit source code** in `src/power-apps/EmployeeRecognitionApp_v0.9.0/Source/`
2. **📦 Use VS Code task** to package your changes
3. **🌐 Upload to Power Apps web** using the portal link task
4. **🧪 Test thoroughly** in the web editor
5. **💾 Export and unpack** when satisfied with changes

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Use VS Code tasks** for fastest workflow (Ctrl+Shift+P → Tasks)
- **Check status first** with `.\scripts\powerapps-web.ps1 status`
- **Keep the reference guide handy** - VS Code task "📖 Open Power Apps Web Reference"
- **Test packaged apps** before committing source code changes
- **Use semantic versioning** for .msapp files in releases folder
