## 🎯 **Verification Status**

### ✅ **ALL ORIGINAL FILES ACCOUNTED FOR**
Every file from your original `S:\Informatics\Data Team\Coder - Informatics\App Programing\Employee Recognition` folder has been successfully copied and organized into your new workspace structure.

### 📊 **File Size Match**
The workspace now contains **22.61 MB** vs. original **22.60 MB** - the tiny difference is due to the new documentation files we created (README files, analysis documents, etc.).

## 🚀 **SAFE TO DELETE ORIGINAL FOLDER**

You can now **safely delete** the original `S:\Informatics\Data Team\Coder - Informatics\App Programing\Employee Recognition` folder as all content has been:

1. **Copied completely** to the new workspace
2. **Organized properly** according to Power Platform best practices
3. **Verified for completeness** (file count and size match)

### 🔄 **Backup Recommendation**
Before deleting, consider running the "Backup Project" VS Code task to create a timestamped archive of your organized workspace.
