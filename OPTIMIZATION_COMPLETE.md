## Next Steps & Recommendations

### 🚀 **Immediate Actions**
1. **Test the setup**: Run one of the VS Code tasks to verify everything works
2. **Review file organization**: Ensure all your files were properly categorized
3. **Test GitHub Copilot**: Verify it's working properly in this optimized workspace
4. **Initialize Git**: Consider setting up version control for your project

### 📈 **Ongoing Development**
1. **Use the tasks**: Leverage the pre-configured VS Code tasks for common operations
2. **Follow naming conventions**: Use the established patterns for consistency
3. **Document changes**: Keep documentation updated as you develop
4. **Regular backups**: Use the backup task for important milestones

### 🔄 **Advanced Setup** (Optional)
1. **Git Repository**: Initialize version control for proper ALM
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated deployment processes
3. **Testing Framework**: Implement systematic testing procedures
4. **Monitoring**: Set up flow run monitoring and alerting
