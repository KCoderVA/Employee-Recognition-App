Copy all files to your target workspace, maintaining the folder structure:

```powershell
# Navigate to your target workspace root
cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Target\Workspace"

# Copy entire copilot-export folder contents
Copy-Item "C:\Path\To\copilot-export\*" -Destination "." -Recurse -Force
```

### Option 2: Selective Import
Copy only specific components you need:

#### For Copilot Instructions Only:
```powershell
# Copy just the copilot instructions
Copy-Item "copilot-export\.github\copilot-instructions.md" ".github\" -Force
```

#### For Core Automation:
```powershell
# Copy scripts and VS Code tasks
Copy-Item "copilot-export\scripts\*" "scripts\" -Recurse -Force
Copy-Item "copilot-export\.vscode\tasks.json" ".vscode\" -Force
```

#### For CI/CD Workflows:
```powershell
# Copy GitHub workflows
Copy-Item "copilot-export\.github\workflows\*" ".github\workflows\" -Recurse -Force
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Requirements

### Prerequisites
1. **PowerShell 7+** (pwsh) - Required for all automation scripts
2. **Git** - Required for repository health checks and safe commit functionality
3. **VS Code** with GitHub Copilot extension
4. **Power Platform CLI** (if using Power Platform tasks) - Install with: `winget install Microsoft.PowerPlatformCLI`

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows script execution:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. Create required folder structure in your target workspace:
   ```
   your-workspace/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .vscode/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ releases/
   ```

### First-Time Setup Steps
1. **Import the package** using one of the installation options above
2. **Customize the copilot-instructions.md** file to match your project specifics:
   - Update project architecture descriptions
   - Modify file paths to match your project structure
   - Adjust naming conventions and standards
   - Update any project-specific URLs or references
3. **Test the VS Code tasks**:
   ```
   Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí Select a task to test
   ```
4. **Verify PowerShell scripts** work in your environment:
   ```powershell
   # Test repository health check
   .\scripts\repo-health-check.ps1 -Detailed
   ```

## üîß Customization Guide

### Adapting for Your Project Type

#### For Non-Power Platform Projects:
1. Remove or modify Power Platform specific tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`
2. Update file paths in `scripts/powerapps-web.ps1` or remove if not needed
3. Adjust project architecture section in `copilot-instructions.md`

#### For Different Technology Stacks:
1. **Replace Power Platform CLI commands** with your stack's build tools
2. **Update naming conventions** in copilot-instructions.md
3. **Modify file organization patterns** to match your project structure
4. **Adjust code standards** section for your languages/frameworks

#### For Different Repository Structures:
1. **Update file paths** in all scripts and tasks
2. **Modify folder organization** patterns in workspace-cleanup.ps1
3. **Adjust backup commands** in VS Code tasks to target your key folders

### Quick Command Triggers Customization
The copilot instructions include these default triggers:
- **"Clean workspace"** ‚Üí Executes comprehensive workspace cleanup
- **"Health check"** ‚Üí Runs repository health analysis
- **"Organize files"** ‚Üí Reorganizes files to logical locations
- **"Fix workspace"** ‚Üí Analyzes and fixes workspace organization

You can add your own triggers by following this pattern in `copilot-instructions.md`:
```markdown
### **üéØ Your Custom Commands**
When the user types any of these short commands, automatically execute your custom workflow:

- **"Your trigger"** - Description of what happens
- **"Another trigger"** - Execute specific tasks

**Actions Include:**
1. Run specific VS Code task
2. Execute custom script
3. Perform validation checks
4. Generate reports
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

The automation includes multiple safety layers:

### File Protection
- **Critical file patterns** that are never deleted during cleanup
- **Multi-layer protection checks** before any file operations
- **Dry-run modes** for testing changes before execution

### Git Safety
- **Pre-commit hooks** that validate changes before commits
- **CHANGELOG enforcement** to ensure all changes are documented
- **Repository health checks** to catch issues early

### Error Recovery
- **Autonomous error handling** that automatically retries failed operations
- **Content filter bypass** protocols for Copilot when encountering blocks
- **Graceful degradation** when tools or dependencies are unavailable

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

### Keeping Scripts Updated
The scripts in this package are designed to be self-maintaining, but you should:
1. **Periodically review** the protection patterns in workspace-cleanup.ps1
2. **Update file paths** if your project structure changes
3. **Adjust validation rules** in the health check scripts as needed

### Version Control Integration
The package includes GitHub workflows that automatically:
- **Enforce CHANGELOG updates** on pull requests
- **Validate repository health** on commits
- **Check compliance** with coding standards

### Extension and Enhancement
You can extend the functionality by:
1. **Adding new PowerShell scripts** to the scripts/ folder
2. **Creating additional VS Code tasks** that reference your scripts
3. **Enhancing the copilot instructions** with project-specific commands
4. **Adding new GitHub workflows** for additional automation

## üìû Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PowerShell Execution Policy Errors:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**VS Code Tasks Not Found:**
- Ensure `.vscode/tasks.json` is in your workspace root
- Reload VS Code window: Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"

**Script Path Issues:**
- Verify all file paths in scripts match your project structure
- Update relative paths in tasks.json if needed

**Copilot Not Responding to Commands:**
- Ensure `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is present and properly formatted
- Restart VS Code to reload Copilot instructions

### Performance Optimization
- **Exclude large folders** from health checks by updating the scripts
- **Adjust cleanup frequency** based on your development patterns
