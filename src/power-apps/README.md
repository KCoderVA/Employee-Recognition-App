This folder contains the Power Apps canvas application source code and exports for the Employee Recognition project.

## Structure

- `EmployeeRecognitionApp_v0.9.0/` - **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** - Latest source code for editing
- `EmployeeRecognitionApp_Unpacked/` - Legacy unpacked source code
- `app_Variables_and_Collections.yml` - Application variables and collections configuration
- `*.zip` - Exported Power Apps packages for different versions

## Web-Based Development Workflow

### üåê **Power Apps Web Editor Only**
Since desktop Power Apps Studio is restricted, all development uses the web-based workflow:

1. **Source Code Development** (VS Code)
   - Edit `.fx.yaml` files in `EmployeeRecognitionApp_v0.9.0/Source/Src/`
   - Use version control for all changes

2. **Packaging** (Command Line)
   - Pack source to `.msapp` using Power Platform CLI
   - Use VS Code task: `üì¶ Package Power App v0.9.0 (Source Control)`

3. **Import to Web** (https://make.powerapps.com)
   - Upload `.msapp` file manually through web interface
   - Test and refine in web editor

4. **Export from Web** (when ready)
   - Download updated `.msapp` from web editor
   - Unpack to source control for continued development

### üîÑ **Development Cycle**

```

## Development Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- Controls: Use descriptive names (btnSubmit, lblTitle, galItems)
- Variables: Use camelCase (currentUser, selectedRecord)
- Collections: Use PascalCase (EmployeeCollection, AwardTypes)

### Best Practices
- Group related controls in containers
- Use consistent color themes and fonts
- Implement proper error handling with User() and IsError() functions
- Use collections efficiently and avoid excessive delegation warnings
- Structure formulas for readability with proper indentation

## File Descriptions

### app_Variables_and_Collections.yml
Contains the configuration for:
- Global variables used across the app
- Collections and their structure
- Default values and initialization logic

## Version Control
- Keep unpacked source code in version control
- Tag major releases
- Document changes in commit messages
