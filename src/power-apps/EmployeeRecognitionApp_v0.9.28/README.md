This folder contains the exported and staged files for version 0.9.28 of the Employee Recognition Canvas App. The structure below is prepared for ALM and source control best practices.

- `msapp/` — Contains the .msapp file for this version (to be unpacked)

- `archive/` — For archiving original export files or previous versions
- `manifest.json` — Export manifest
- `Microsoft.PowerApps/` — Original export folder (to be archived after unpacking)

## Next Steps
